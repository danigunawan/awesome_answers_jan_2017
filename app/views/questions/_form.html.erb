<%# form_for is a Rails helper (built-in) generate a form to create or updated_at
    a record in the database through a controller. `form_for` expects to be
    given an ActiveRecord object as its first argument. If the object is not
    persisted then the form will use POST request and the URL will be the create
    action path which is in this case `questions_path`.
    We also have access to the `f` object which eases creating fields for the
    form. The field will be automatically pre-populated with any data set in
    the object (such as title / body). It will also automatically set special
    `name` attributes to the generated fields. %>
    <%# `form_for` will look at the first arguemnt (in this @question) if @question
        is persisted which is the case here as we're editing an existing question,
        `form_for` will use  question_path(@question) for its action and it will
        use `PATCH` for its request by including a hidden field with name `_method`
        and value `PATCH` to mimick a PATCH request %>

<p><%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(', ') %></p>
<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :body %>
    <%= f.text_area :body %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :tag_ids %>
    <%= f.collection_check_boxes :tag_ids, Tag.all, :id, :name do |b| %>
      <div class='tag-wrapper'>
        <%= b.check_box %>
        <%= b.text %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
