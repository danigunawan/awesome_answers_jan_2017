$('#answers').prepend('<%= j render 'answer', ans: @answer, style: 'display:none' %>');
$('#<%= dom_id(@answer) %>').slideDown();

<%# we need to re-instantiate @answer in here because @answer is persisted which
    mean that the form will attempt to submit to the `update` action which has
    a url of `question_answer_path` (we don't want that) we want the form to
    just submit to create action again which we can do by re-instantiating
    `@answer` to a new `Answer` %>
<% @answer = Answer.new %>
$('#new_answer').replaceWith("<%= j render 'form' %>");
