  # this sets up one-to-many association between the question and the answer
  # in this case a question has many answers (note that to set a one-to-many
  # association you will have to pluralize `answer` - Rails convention)
  # we will have many handy method to helps us query associated records.
  # for instance we can do:
  # q = Question.last
  # answers = q.answers
  # the line above will fetch all the answers associated with question: q
  # It's highly recommended that you add the `dependent` option to the
  # association which tells Rails what to do when you delete a question that
  # has answers associated with it, the most popular options are:
  # destroy: which will delete all associated answers before deleting the
  #          question
  # nullify: which will update all the `question_id` fields on the associated
  #          answers to be come `NULL` before deleting the question


  has_many :likes, dependent: :destroy
  # ðŸ‘‡ will create an instance method named likers that will get all users that
  # liked the question
  # through - this argument defines which model is used for the join (i.e. the table that
  # has a reference to the user and the question)
  # source - this argument defines what is the target reference from the like model
