  # looks like `/admin/dashboard` that will map to `admin/dashboard` controller
  namespace :admin do

  # the above route maps any `GET` request with `/` URL to the index action
  # within the WelcomeController (action is a method defined within the
  # controller class)
  # the above can be called DSL (Domain Specific Language). It's just Ruby it's
  # not a special programming language, just Ruby. The Ruby is written in a way
  # that looks like its own language

  # shallow: true option makes it so nested routes only include '/questions/:question_id'
  # for the create action and not for `destroy` for instance. This is because
  # when deleting a nested resouces you may not need to know about the parent
  # resource because you can get it from the Database. In our case, we can
  # get the question_id of an answer from the database

    # routes. This will make all the `answers` routes prefixed with
